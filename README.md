# Battleship Project
Javascript capstone for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) - Node/JS Path

Built in Typescript.

W3.css is used minimally for page formatting. All app formatting and DOM control is in a separate css and ts files.

## Current State
- P1 is a human player and can place ships, make attacks, and win or lose the game
- P2 is a computer player that can make random moves (place ships and make attacks)
- Game alerts on win/lose conditions

## Planed improvements 
- Add pretty game win display and scores
- Add rotation to ship placements
- Add 2 x human player and swap screen function

## Learning Goals
- TDD using Jest
- Improve separation of concerns, classes and modules
- Bundling using Tsup
